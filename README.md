# Readme von taxiwriter.github.io
## This github instance is used mainly as a playground for developing css-layouts

*nothing* more to say - **explore**, what I have done so far :)

With this github instance, this is my first time to use:
1. **markdown** to write this *readme.me*
	* markdown as it is
	* alternative for *mediawiki*
 	* read it
2. **less** and **scss** using with **css**
3. finished..
	* again
	* a list
	* of what
4. **you** *don't* ***really***
### need!
